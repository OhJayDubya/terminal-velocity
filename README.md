# Terminal Velocity
In this day and age we have access to an almost unlimited supply of video games. Every genre we can imagine can be played right at our fingertips with our Smartphones, at home on the sofa with a number of consoles or sitting behind a custom built battle-station with the most powerful hardware on the planet.

However when it comes to the creation of video games one of my favorite movements is the developers who challenge themselves to create games in the most inhospitable and unlikely of places. Everything from creating a FPS in just CSS, creating a game that runs just in your URL or my personal favorite the people who get DOOM to run on everything and anything.

So in tribute to my favorite game development movement I wanted to try my hand at it as well and asked myself, "Could I create a game in just Terminal?". For this I decided to set some basic rules to make sure that I was staying true to the movement and that most importantly it's fun:

1. It has to run in a standard terminal (or windows command prompt) with no extra software.
2. The graphics need to be character that can be displayed in the terminal.
3. You need to be able to control the game with the keyboard keys.
4. And finally the game needs to be quick and exciting, like an arcade game.

**Basic Game Design**

When it comes to the design of the game I want it to revolve around a few key concepts. Firstly I want each game to be quick so that each attempt can be over in a few seconds, for it to be super simple to play so that anyone can pick it up and finally to have some incentive such as a high score or timer.

When it comes to deciding what kind of game to make this is where things get a bit more difficult. Not only do I want to create a game that matches the concepts that I have listed above, but I also need to make sure that the game can actually run in terminal without massive performance issues. For these reasons I decided to keep it simple and have a game that is all about avoiding fast moving incoming objects and racking up a score based on how long you can survive.
